    Hello ${name},
    are you ready for an <wave>epic</wave> story?

  # Character dialogue can be done using single-entry maps.
  - Alice: Hello, my name is Alice. This is how you write a dialogue line in Kataru!
  - Bob: Hi Alice, I'm Bob. Here is another line of dialogue. Isn't it nice how all character names are validated upon parsing?
  - Alice: It sure is, Bob!
  - Bob: Get ready though, soon you'll have to make a choice. Will you continue reading, or stop here?

  # Choices are represented as a mapping.
  - choices:
      continue: inv:Start
      stop: End
