    Welcome to Kataru!
    「カタル」へようこそ!
    Kataru is a dialogue engine build completely on top of YAML with a focus on ease of implementation and simplicity of writing.
  - Alice: Hello, my name is Alice. This is how you write a dialogue line in Kataru!
  - Bob: Hi Alice, I'm Bob. Here is another line of dialogue. Isn't it nice how all character names are validated upon parsing?
  - Alice: It sure is, Bob!
  - Bob: Get ready though, soon you'll have to make a choice. Will you continue reading, or stop here?
  - choices:
      continue: intro:Start
      stop: End
    timeout: 1

End:
  - End of story. Thanks for playing!
